# AMIT FULL STACK E-COMMERCE FINAL PROJECT 

### please follow these steps to set up and run the application

**Open Laravel folder -> Final project -> and then in the terminal enter : "composer update"**

### Please use the e-commerce.sql database file and import it in your phpMyAdmin ... because I made it to make the website looks to be professional and perfectly fit in the website and not only a dumb data


**then in the terminal enter : php artisan serve** 


**Finally you can open the application : Vue -> e-commerce then open the folder terminal and then :**
**npm run dev**

**then you can open the website and login with the admin email and password that are already stored in the e-commerce database to access the dashboard or regiser a new user that will not access dashboard**

**admin email : kemoayman2015@gmail.com**
**admin password : kareemAdmin1234**

**note : the admin can access the dashboard from a button in the navbar**

**i hope you like it**
